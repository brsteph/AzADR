# Cloud Functions

For responsibility alignment across teams, see the [RACI Matrix](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/raci-alignment) provided as part of the Cloud Adoption Framework.

| Cloud Function | Summary | Fulfilled by | Critical for Migrations? |
|----------------|---------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| [Cloud Strategy](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-strategy) | A cloud strategy team defines motivations and business outcomes, and validates and maintains alignment between business priorities and cloud adoption efforts. In the absence of a defined cloud strategy team, someone must still provide the functionality that aligns technical activities to business outcomes. That same person or group should also manage change across the project. | ``Team, vTeam, or Person`` | **Critical** |
| [Cloud Adoption](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-adoption) | Cloud adoption functions enable the implementation of technical solutions in the cloud. Like any IT project, the people delivering the actual work will determine success. The teams providing the necessary cloud adoption functions can be staffed from multiple subject matter experts or implementation partners.  Cloud adoption teams are the modern-day equivalent of technical implementation teams or project teams | ``Team, vTeam, or Person`` | **Critical** |
| [Cloud Governance](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-governance) | A cloud governance team ensure that risks and risk tolerance are properly evaluated and managed. This team ensures the proper identification of risks that can't be tolerated by the business. The people on this team convert risks into governing corporate policies. | ``Team, vTeam, or Person`` | **Critical** |
| [Central IT](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/central-it) | As cloud adoption scales, cloud governance functions alone may not be sufficient to govern adoption efforts. When adoption is gradual, teams tend to organically develop the skills and processes needed to be ready for the cloud over time.  When cloud adoption expands from one team to multiple teams relatively quickly, additional support from existing IT staff is needed. But those staff members may lack the training and experience required to support the cloud using cloud-native IT tools. This often drives the formation of a central IT team governing the cloud. | ``Team, vTeam, or Person`` | **Critical** |
| [Cloud Operations](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-operations) | An operations team focuses on monitoring, repairing, and the remediation of issues related to traditional IT operations and assets. In the cloud, many of the capital costs and operations activities are transferred to the cloud provider, giving IT operations the opportunity to improve and provide significant additional value. | ``Team, vTeam, or Person`` | **Critical** |
| [Cloud Center of Excellence](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-center-of-excellence) | Many IT organizations share the core objective of achieving business and technical agility. A cloud center of excellence (CCoE) is a function that helps organizations balance speed and stability while they pursue this objective. | ``Team, vTeam, or Person`` | *Not Critical* |
| [Cloud Platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-platform) | While the cloud presents the opportunity to learn new skills, your current architects should be able to directly apply their experiences and subject matter expertise. Cloud platform functions are usually provided by a select group of architects who focus on learning about the cloud platform. These architects then aid others in decision making and the proper application of controls to cloud environments. | ``Team, vTeam, or Person`` | *Not Critical* |
| [Cloud Automation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-automation) | During cloud adoption efforts, cloud automation functions unlock the potential of DevOps and a cloud-native approach. Expertise in each of these areas can accelerate adoption and innovation. | ``Team, vTeam, or Person`` | *Not Critical* |
| [Cloud Data](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-data) | There are multiple audiences involved in an analytics conversation, including the typical seller, database architect, and infrastructure team. In addition, analytics solutions involve influencers, recommenders, and decision-makers from enterprise architecture, data science, business analysts, and executive leadership roles. | ``Team, vTeam, or Person`` | *Not Critical* |
| [Cloud Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security) | Various security teams - see CAF reference | ``Team, vTeam, or Person`` | **Critical** |
